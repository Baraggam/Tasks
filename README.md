How to use:\
Create a "tasks.in" file in the same directory as the java or python file\
Fill the file with the information about the resource and the tasks as described below\
"\
n // Resource's Ram\
HH:MM:SS // Start of the resource\
HH:MM:SS // End of the resource\
name HH:MM:SS duration resource // TASK: name, begin, end, duration (in seconds), the amount of the resource (in MB)\
name HH:MM:SS duration resource\
